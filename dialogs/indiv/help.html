<p><strong>Individual Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Perturbs parameters individually, one at a time, and by the same percentage.</p>
<p>This type of analysis is useful to find to which parameters a variable is sensitive the most.</p>
<p>The number of simulations will equal the number of parameters to analyze plus one, the simulation corresponding to the standard unperturbed run.</p>
<p><strong>Known limitations</strong></p>
<p>Only parameters and variables of type Real are recognized. Renamings like 'type MyType = Real' are not supported either.</p>
<p>Arrays of any type are also not yet supported.</p>
